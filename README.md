# **Project Overview**
Using patient clinical data, this project is an end-to-end machine learning application that forecasts the risk of heart disease. The entire data science workflow is covered, including model training, evaluation, and deployment through a Streamlit web application, as well as data ingestion and exploratory analysis. Instead of focusing on isolated model training, this project aims to showcase useful, production-oriented data science skills.

# **Problem Statement**
Heart disease continues to rank among the world's top causes of death. Using clinical indicators to identify high-risk patients early on can help medical professionals make decisions and provide preventative care. Using frequently gathered medical data, this project develops a classification model that forecasts a patient's likelihood of having heart disease.

# **Tools and Technologies**
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy – data manipulation
- SQLite – lightweight database storage
- Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualisation
- Scikit-learn – preprocessing, modeling, evaluation
- Joblib – model persistence
- Streamlit – interactive web application

# **Model Performance (Best Model: SVM)**
### Accuracy: ~92%
**Caution:** _This project should not be utilized for medical diagnosis; it is solely intended for educational purposes._

# **Future Improvements**
- Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning
- Feature importance analysis
- Improved UI/UX for the Streamlit app
- Deployment on a cloud platform
- Adding model explainability
