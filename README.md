**Project Overview**
Using patient clinical data, this project is an end-to-end machine learning application that forecasts the risk of heart disease. The entire data science workflow is covered, including model training, evaluation, and deployment through a Streamlit web application, as well as data ingestion and exploratory analysis. Instead of focusing on isolated model training, this project aims to showcase useful, production-oriented data science skills.

**Tools and Technologies**
Python
Pandas & NumPy – data manipulation
SQLite – lightweight database storage
Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualisation
Scikit-learn – preprocessing, modeling, evaluation
Joblib – model persistence
Streamlit – interactive web application

**Model Performance (Best Model: SVM)**
Accuracy: ~92%
Caution: This project should not be utilized for medical diagnosis; it is solely intended for educational purposes.
